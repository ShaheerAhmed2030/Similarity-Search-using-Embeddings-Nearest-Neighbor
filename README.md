# Similarity Search using Embeddings & Nearest Neighbor

### Problem Statement: 
You've been tasked with developing a recommendation system for a grocery delivery service based on user preferences. The goal is to suggest items that are similar to those already chosen by the user. However, traditional methods like keyword matching or simple collaborative filtering may not capture nuanced similarities between items.

### Solution:
We propose an embedding based system utilizing embeddings to represent each word. After that, a K-nearest neighbor search algorithm was implemented to efficiently find items that are closest to a given query item in the embedding space.
